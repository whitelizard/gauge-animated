# gauge-animated
A physically animated Gauge, using [velocitymodel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/velocitymodel)

Demo [here](http://codepen.io/whitelizard/pen/ggVoOR?editors=0010)

Look at the bottom section of the JS code window in the demo to find the configurations (API use) of all the examples.

The API is rather extensive and allows for a lot of customization to create very different looking gauges.

The face of the gauge is made with a `<canvas>`, the text lables are just `<div>`'s, and the needle is `<svg>`
